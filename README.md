# Servant Boilerplate: MEAN Stack

A Servant Boilerplate Application already integrated with Servant built on the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) stack.

##### Features

* Lean MEAN-stack:  There is very little bloat here
* User Management: User Authentication via Servant is already built and ready to use.  User Libraries like Passport are not needed!
* Single Page Application
* Database Not Necessary: A MongoDB database is set-up, but since this is a Servant app, you don't have to use one!
