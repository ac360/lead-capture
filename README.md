# Servant Boilerplate: MEAN Stack

A Servant Boilerplate Application already integrated with Servant built on the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) stack.

## Features

* **Lean MEAN Stack:** There is very little bloat in this version of the MEAN stack.
* **User Management:** User Authentication via Servant is already built and ready to use.  Authentication libraries like Passport are not needed!
* **Single Page Application:** Architected to be an easy-to-use Single Plage Application.
* **Database Not Necessary:** A MongoDB database is set-up, but since this is a Servant app, you may not need one.
