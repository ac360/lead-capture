# Servant Boilerplate: MEAN Stack

A Servant Boilerplate Application already integrated with Servant built on the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) stack.

## Features

* Lean MEAN-stack – There is very little bloat in this MEAN stack.
* User Management – User Authentication via Servant is already built and ready to use.  Authentication libraries like Passport are not needed!
* Single Page Application
* Database Not Necessary – A MongoDB database is set-up, but since this is a Servant app, you may not need one.
